<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 School Library <a name="about-project"></a>

**In this project, I started building the school library app. In the initial step, I implemented the classes to represent students and teachers. I then went on to decorate these classes by ensuring that certain classes don't exceed a certain number of characters and ensuring that some variables begin with a capital letter. From there I created associations between respective classes. To finish the app, I created a basic UI which is a console UI with commands to navigate the app.**
